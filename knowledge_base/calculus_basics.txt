Calculus Basics

Derivatives:
- Definition: f'(x) = lim(h→0) [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h
- Power rule: d/dx(xⁿ) = nxⁿ⁻¹
- Product rule: (fg)' = f'g + fg'
- Quotient rule: (f/g)' = (f'g - fg') / g²
- Chain rule: (f(g(x)))' = f'(g(x)) × g'(x)

Integrals:
- Antiderivative: ∫f(x)dx = F(x) + C
- Power rule: ∫xⁿdx = xⁿ⁺¹/(n+1) + C

Limits:
- Evaluate by substitution, factoring, or L'Hôpital's rule

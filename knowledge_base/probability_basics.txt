Probability Basics

Key Concepts:
- Probability: P(event) = favorable outcomes / total outcomes
- Range: 0 ≤ P ≤ 1
- Complement: P(not A) = 1 - P(A)

Common Formulas:
- P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B) if independent
- P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
- Conditional: P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

Example: Probability of rolling 6 on a die
P(6) = 1/6 ≈ 0.167

Algebra Basics

Key Concepts:
- Variables: x, y, z represent unknown values
- Equations: expressions with = sign
- Solving: isolate the variable

Common Operations:
- Addition/Subtraction: x + 5 = 10 → x = 5
- Multiplication/Division: 3x = 15 → x = 5
- Quadratic Formula: x = (-b ± √(b²-4ac)) / 2a

Example: Solve 2x + 3 = 11
Step 1: Subtract 3 from both sides → 2x = 8
Step 2: Divide by 2 → x = 4

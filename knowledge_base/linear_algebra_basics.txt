Linear Algebra Basics

Matrices:
- Addition: element-wise
- Multiplication: row × column
- Determinant: det(A) for 2×2: ad - bc
- Inverse: A⁻¹ = (1/det(A)) × adj(A)

Vectors:
- Dot product: a·b = Σaᵢbᵢ
- Cross product: a×b (3D only)

Systems of Equations:
- Use elimination or substitution
- Matrix form: Ax = b → x = A⁻¹b
